## Corsair Calculator
What is this project?
This project aims to make a script that can easilly read, write, and manage the character
sheets of my home brew roleplaying system CORSAIR. It is not intended to be a full game
but rather a system that can assist me in playing the table top game.

## What do I have so far?
* 'Entity' Class to store character sheets
* Reading and parsing from a text file to a class

## What are my long term goals?
* Fully functional Entity and Item classes
* Storing Characters in dynamic lists
* Exporting Characters to text files
* Add a text interface to process actions ie: "Entity 1 attack entity 2 with item"
* Add a text based front end that walks someone through creating a character within constraints
* Random generation of new characters within constraints
* The ability to define and edit the constraints within a text file

## What are my short term goals? (what I'm working on right now)
* Finish off the Entity and Item classes
* Impliment separate compilation so it's not all just one file
* Make a function that can write a character to a file (in the same format that it's read)

## How do you use it?
Currently, it is unfinished and there is no executable. Place any character .txt files in the
same directory as the CorsairCalculator.cpp file. When running the script it will prompt you to type
in the name of any files you want to read without the extension
